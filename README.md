# Differential Drive Controller

A minimal, embedded motor-control project focused on building a clean
differential-drive foundation for mobile robots.

## Objectives
- Implement PWM motor speed control
- Control left/right motors independently
- Build toward encoder feedback and PID speed regulation

## Repository Structure
- `src/` — control code
- `docs/` — diagrams and technical notes

## Current Status
- Repository initialized
- Project structure created

## Next Steps
- Spin a single DC motor using PWM
- Add second motor for differential drive
